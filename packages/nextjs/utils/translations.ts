One of them is \"circulation is mining\", which has created a unique mechanism of global circulation transfer and mining, supporting multiple EVM wallets worldwide. Users can start mining by transferring tokens, and 10% of each transfer is released as mining pool tokens through a computing power protocol, thus achieving wealth effects of more circulation and more computing power with more payments. The second is' circulation is destruction ', where 10% of each transfer goes directly into the black hole, and the 10% released computing power is also destroyed simultaneously. As the number of payers increases, tokens become increasingly scarce, creating a strong deflationary effect that drives the continuous rise of TCM value and brings considerable returns to investors.",
